# Gate Practical question

Create an Express.js middleware function called `requestLogger` that logs the following information for every incoming request:

- HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST)
- URL path
- Timestamp of the request
- Response time (in milliseconds)

Then:

1. Integrate this middleware into an Express app.
2. The app should have at least **two routes** (`/` and `/users`) that return a JSON response.
3. Ensure the middleware runs for **all routes** and prints logs in the following format:

      

```jsx
[2025-11-11T18:23:10Z] GET /users - 5ms
```
